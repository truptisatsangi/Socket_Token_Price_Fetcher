A Multi-Chain Voting System that leverages the power of Socket Protocol to enable seamless voting across multiple blockchain networks. Users can vote on any supported chain, and their votes are aggregated and synchronized across all participating networks.

This system ensures that users enjoy a decentralized, transparent, and efficient voting experience, regardless of the chain they choose to interact with.

# Features

### Cross-Chain Voting:

Users can cast votes from any blockchain supported by Socket Protocol.
Votes are instantly recorded and aggregated across chains.

### Aggregated Results:

Votes from different chains are combined in real-time, ensuring up-to-date and comprehensive voting statistics.

### Seamless Integration:

Powered by Socket Protocol, enabling seamless communication between chains for a frictionless experience.

### Transparency and Security:

Utilizes blockchain's inherent transparency to ensure every vote is verifiable.
Smart contracts are audited to maintain security and trust.
How It Works

### Smart Contracts on Multiple Chains:

Deploy voting contracts on all supported chains.
Each contract collects votes for a specific proposal.

### Socket Protocol Integration:

Enables cross-chain communication to aggregate votes.
Fetches data such as vote counts and gas prices from multiple chains.

### Vote Aggregation:

A central aggregator gathers votes from all chains and provides a combined total.
Users can view live aggregated results.

### User-Friendly Interface:

A web-based dApp where users can select their desired chain, cast votes, and view results.
Provides details such as minimum gas price for transactions and the chain with the highest participation.

# Use Cases

### Decentralized Governance:

Allow DAOs and decentralized communities to conduct fair and transparent elections across multiple chains.

### Global Polls and Surveys:

Conduct cross-chain opinion polls where users from any network can participate.

### Cross-Chain Event Voting:

Enable voting for global events or initiatives involving multiple blockchain ecosystems.

# About Socket Protocol

> The protocol is on alpha-stage and in active development.

SOCKET Protocol is the first chain-abstraction protocol, enabling developers to build chain-abstracted applications to compose users, accounts and applications across 300+ rollups and chains. Chain-Abstraction is a new computing paradigm for developers, enabling developers to leverage chains as servers/databases, enabling them to reach all users and applications spread across networks while providing a consistent monolithic experience to end users and applications.

SOCKET is a chain-abstraction protocol, not a network(chain/rollup). Using a combination of offchain agents(watchers, transmitters) and onchain contracts(switchboards) it enables application-builders to build truly chain-abstracted protocols.

Next task: Use foundary and complete it to end to end :)
